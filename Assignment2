      <p>Our home automation project is called "Telkom+". It is a deliberate spelling error sourcing from the short-form of Telecommunication, Telcom. This deliberation of this spelling error is due to the characteristic that is common to all people is that they pay more attention to the details when there is something not right, and thus, this is our own way so that people are conscious of our brand</p>

          <H4>Personal Information</H4>
          <p>Hi! My name is Gerald Dwi Cipta. My student number is s3666265 and my email address is <a href="mailto:s3666265@student.rmit.edu.au">s3666265@student.rmit.edu.au</a>.</p>
          <p>Im an international student from Indonesia and currently studying in RMIT's finest Australian campus graduating in winter 2020. As for now, I'm only able to speak Indonesian, English, Chinese. I'm looking forward to learn French because I think that it is an interesting language to communicate with. I consider Racing is my main sport and my hobby. A really interesting fact about me is when i eat a pizza slice, i often leave the crust because I think that it just taste too doughy and i dislike it. My interest in IT includes designing the database architecture. When I was 15 years old, before I took this BP308 Business Information Systems, my elder brother showed me a couple of his projects, which included him putting his customer base for his phone application in a database using MySQL. In just one line of SQL, he could filter out his under 18 users, over 50 users and can see the demographic of his customer base when he needs to review his target market for the application. Me at that point of time not knowing anything about databases, I was amazed and keen to learn more about this database management systems, asked what course is available to learn more about this database and my study agent recommended me this BP308 course.</p>

          <p>The MBTI test shows that I'm a Debater (ENTP-T), after a further reading of what a debater personality means, it shows that I'm an excellent brainstormer where a debater can analyse problems in every point of view and tackle the problem in every aspect. Debaters also are quick thinkers, knowledgeable, energetic and charismatic. On the other side, from the learning style test, it shows that I'm a "Tactile Learner" where i learn by touching, which means that I need to have a grasp of the item or object that I'm learning by doing, which means that I'm a type of autodidact, learning to do thing by actively doing it. Last but not least, the creativity test shows that my creativity percentage is 63.16% (average), with that I'm short of the persistence aspect which means that I'm not that type to force myself to improve something that I consider to be "enough" or "good". Compiling everything, all of this test information might be useful to a group by helping a team to brainstorm all problem-solving solutions for all of the current situation. I can also help the team to learn when they do not know or have no idea on how to start the task as I learn while I do while bringing the team with me and go through the task together as a team.</p>

      <h3>John Usaraga</h3>
          <H4>Personal Information</H4>
              <p>Hi there, My name is John Mikael Usaraga, but most people call me Mikey. My studentID is S3842470. I was born in Melbourne, Australia, however, my parents are both Filipino. At home, my parents communicate to me in Tagalog, but I can only understand what they are saying because I have trouble speaking it as English is my native language. I am currently studying the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. My hobbies include playing video games, watching anime and playing sports such as badminton and basketball. I have been playing badminton for 5-6 years now, but I don't play it as frequently as I used to.</p>
              <p>Growing up I had always played video games on console and pc. When playing these games there would sometimes be a new patch/update to a game before it runs. What intrigued me was how these patches were able to improve the game whether it be to fix a bug or to add more content to the game. From this, I started to develop an interest in IT as I wanted to find out how these updates worked. Having researched about it I came to an understanding that IT is used in a lot more interesting ways and am now fascinated by the actual coding/programming behind certain programs/software.  </p>
  <br><br>
          <H4>Team Profile</H4>
              <p><b>Myers-Briggs Test</b> -Protagonist ENFJ-A <br> Mind: 63% Extraverted, 37% Introverted Energy: 60% Intuitive, 40% Observant Nature: 72% Feeling, 28% ThinkingTactics: 71% Judging, 29% Prospecting Identity: 79% Assertive, 21% Turbulent

                  <b>Big Five Personality Test</b>-Openness 85%, Conscientiousness 73%, Extraversion 69%, Agreeableness 73%, Neuroticism 21%<br><br>
                  I feel like these results will influence my behaviour spositively. The traits I have which I believe will be the most influential when working in a team are my intuitiveness, judging personality, extraversion, and agreeableness. When problems are present during a group project, my intuitiveness would allow meto come up with ideas to help improve the situation/issue. This would be supported by my extraversion and agreeableness as I would be able to voice my ideas comfortably without creating any unnecessary arguments. To be more productive when working in the team my judging personality would allow me and others to stay on track, maximising our time working on the project. If things go wrong during the project this personality would also work well with my intuitiveness as I could also come up with other plans if a problem does arise.My protagonist personality states that I take genuine pleasure when "getting to know other people, and have no trouble with people of all types." This would suggest that I would have no problem when forming a team with others as I am comfortable interacting with them. Some of the traits of someone who has a protagonist personality are being optimistic, kind and creative. I believe that these traits would also help me ease into a team of people with whom I have just met.</p>

          <h4>Ideal Job</h4>
              <p>Software Engineer</p>
              <p>My ideal job is working as a software engineer, developing and building computer systems software and applications software. This occupation appeals to me the most as the work I'd do could branch out into developing operating systems and computer games. Due to my experiences growing up, being influenced by video games, I believe that this job is ideal for me. For this job, I would need to master a variety of programming languages, such as C++, C#, JavaScript, and Python. Some general skills I would also need to have for this job include software development, Object-oriented design (OOD), Software testing and debugging, problem-solving and logical thinking, written and verbal communication, teamwork.</p>
              <p>Comparing this job with those of the other members of this group, I have come to realize how IT can expand into different types of jobs. Out of the 6 members of the group, I do share the same Job interest with one of them. What differentiates my ideal job with the rest, is that this job focuses on developing and building computer systems software and applications software, whereas the other ones focus on aspects such as: carrying out security measures to protect computer networks and systems, managing inventory tracking systems, designing software systems and applications, and analyzing how well software and hardware fit the business needs of their employer or a client. Although, as most of the jobs each group member finds ideal is different, they all do share a similarity when it comes to some of the requirements for the job and also some general skills to have.</p>

      <h3>Nicholas Santosa</h3>
          <H4>Personal Information</H4>
              <p>Hello, my name is Nicholas Christopher Santosa. My RMIT student id is s3844591 and my RMIT student email is <a
                href='mailto:s3844591@student.rmit.edu.au'>s3844591@student.rmit.edu.au</a>.
            I was born in New Zealand, Auckland on March 23rd, 2002, Saturday. From 2007 onwards I have been living in
            Melbourne and grew up in an Indonesian household. My first language is English and I'm somewhat fluent in
            Bahasa (Indonesian). I'm currently undertaking a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT and in my first
            year. I have finished school from Prep to Year 12. I went to Stella Maris in Point Cook for my Primary
            school and moved to Emmanuel College Notre Dame Campus from year 7 to 12. I have a pet dog. She's a Labrador, her name is Nugget and has been in my family for two years. My main hobby
            is cars, more about JDM and modifying cars, but I also enjoy watching F1 and the overall understanding of
            how cars work. I also enjoy music and play the guitar, piano and have a passion for singing.</p>
  <br><br>
          <H4>Team Profile</H4>
              <p>The Myers Briggs test results show that I’m an Advocate (INFJ-T). Upon further inspection an Advocate has an introverted mind, intuitive energy, feeling nature, judging tactics and turbulent identity. An advocate is sensitive to how others feel, creative and focused on the future. I believe I have all of those traits except for the Intuitive nature, where I believe I am more observant and can pick things up. According to the Learning test I took, I’m a visual learner. As a visual learner I need graphs, pictures and to read reports to understand the content better. I need to be able to write down information to contain it. This test accurately represents how I learn. I usually study using pictures and notes that use colour or diagrams to study. My creativity test result is 55.01, this means I can manage with work given to me in quantities and manage it very well, showing how organised I am. My work can be anything and I will be able to accept the work, even if it's contradictory. My perspective also shows that I am able to shift my perspective depending on the situation, making me flexible. I believe this test is also accurate, I feel like I’m very organised being on top of everything I do and I’m able to complete multiple different tasks. The test also says that I can shift my perspective depending on the situation and I think that's true, there have been many accounts where I can adapt to the situation. I probably feel like I need a bit of apparent connection before I can understand it and that I have more persistence then what the test says I do. This information can be helpful to the group, letting them know I can make decisions, my organisation skills, how my learning style is visual and I’m flexible with the workload and my position in the group.</p>

              <H4>Personal Information</H4>
              <p>Hello there, my name is Patrick Cruz and my studentID is s3657537. I'm born in the Philippines but moved to Australia when I was young, so I don't recall much of Philippines. Current education is undertaking a Bachelor of Business majoring in logistics and supply chain management. Previous education is the completion of year 12 and a Diploma of Logistics studied at RMIT. Online gaming is a heavy interest to me and being able to interact with people all over the world in different types of games are one of my main hobbies. My interest in IT is mainly the potential optimization of everyday tasks and chores that can be adapted to utilize a certain technology or program that will streamline the process.
            <br><br>
                My interest in IT came at a young age from playing on the computer for long enough that I wanted to know how they worked. With technology become more and more incorporated within our every day lives, future developments in thecareer field I am pursuing may rely on such technologies. To be able to stay relevant in the required skill sets I believe that it is important to have a good understanding in the way the technology works and not just use it. I chose to come to RMIT because of the location of the main city campus and otherreviews from online friends that took the same course I am currently undergoing. Within my bachelor im currently in the 3rd and final year before completion, within this course introduction to IT I am hoping to understand and be able to further strengthen my knowledge of different applications that may assist the logistical side of business in the future. It is my assumption that the future of Logistics will incorporate far more usage of technology to assist and being able to understand how it all works can be a beneficial skill.</p>

I chose to come to RMIT as I have heard that this university has a known reputation for great success in this course. During my studies I hope to learn more about programming and how technology functions.</p>

        <h4>Ideal Job</h4>
          <p>My ideal job is working as a web developer for any company, a web developer which oversees everything related to a website that is to the company’s vision. So that can be building the website e.g. coding, layout, or design etc. therefore a web developer is expected to have a balance between programming and design. This position is appealing to me as it is relating to IT and there is some sort of creativity, So I can have a new experience every time as I need to design the website to someone’s wants. I would need to have experience in VMS such as WordPress, Magento, Drupal and Joomla, therefore have successfully built websites. This position also requires already have experience in working with agencies and being able to code in the most efficient way possible. This position also requires the web developer to know networking, user interface, data base and knowledge a full stack programmer would know.</p>
          <p>When comparing and contrasting each ideal jobs for each person in the group. It seems like although the common element behind most of ideal jobs are IT related, each job is related to different part of IT/combined with other areas for cyber security Analyst is more focused on security. I think that between our groups job it is somewhat loosely linked for example a system analyst might need to have the skills of a cyber security analyst to improve a system.  So some jobs may share similar aspects of the job. Overall I think that our career plans across the group are quite different as each job goes over the different aspect of IT</p>
